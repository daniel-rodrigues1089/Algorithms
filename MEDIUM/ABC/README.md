create an algorithm to find the value of 3 variables and a sum operation.

example:

```A B C + A B C + A B C = CCC```

solution:

C = 5, because 5 + 5 + 5 = 15, 1 ten and 5 units
B = 8. because 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 = 24. 2 hundreds and 5 ten.
A = 1, because 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5 hundreds

```185 + 185 + 185 = 555```

use elementary arithmetic concept
