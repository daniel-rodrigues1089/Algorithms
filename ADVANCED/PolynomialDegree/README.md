create a library of the algorithm done in #19, use this library to determine the degree of a polynomial.

**_The main objective of this algorithm is to create libraries_**

**input:**

```bash
3x + x^3 - 4 + 3x^3
```

**_use the library to process and order the polynomial, the return will be an array with all the exponents, from this, determine the degree._**

```bash
#return: [3, 1, 0]
```

**output:**

```bash
4 degree
```
